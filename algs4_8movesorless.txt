
Some algorithms for the 4x4x4 Rubik's cube, that permute the top layer's side pieces
while leaving all the pieces in the bottom 3 layers intact.

My search has yielded 2 qualitatively distinct algorithms
of 8 moves each.
Each algorithm can be mirrored from left to right to
yield another algorithm.
The 4 resulting algorithms are shown here.

For each algorithm displayed, the upper part shows
how it permutes the side pieces of the top layer,
but it doesn't show how it permutes the corners.
This is because it's assumed that once you get to the top layer,
you will perform the algorithms below not caring about the corners,
and then you will fix the corners afterwards with algorithms adapted from the 3x3x3 method.
The bottom part is the list of moves in the algorithm.

The move notation works as follows.
Each move is denoted by three elements.
The middle element is which face to turn according to standard notation
  F=front B=back D=bottom U=top L=left R=right
The rightmost element shows whether to rotate the face clockwise, counterclockwise, or 180 degrees.
The leftmost element tells you which layer(s) to rotate, because it's not always only the outer layer.
  If there are several layers, you must rotate each layer the same way (both CCW for example).
  1 means the outer layer, that you would normally expect.
  2 means the inner layer that is adjacent to 1.
  3 means the other inner layer.
  4 means the other outer layer opposite to 1.
  So if the leftmost element says "2 L CW", then you should only rotate
    the inner layer adjacent to the left face, and rotate is CW looking from the left.
    Leave the left face itself intact, because it's layer 1 which was not mentioned in "2 L CW".
